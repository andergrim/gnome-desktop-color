# Gnome desktop color
Gnome Desktop color is a small PyGTK application to set your desktop to a solid color or a color gradient, instead of a picture.

Since Gnome version 3.34 the option to set a solid color or color gradient as the desktop background has been removed from the Gnome Control center. Apparently less is more when it comes to GUI design, but not when it comes to the look and feel of the end users desktops.

If you are like me and don't like unneccessary clutter, or just want to have a plan color desktop background for any other reason you can use this utility to configure it.

This very advanced feature for very advanced users will most likely be added to gnome-tweak-tools sometime in the future. When that happens I will probably not maintain this small hack any more.
